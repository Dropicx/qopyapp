## üì± First Run

### 1. Launch the App

When you first run the Flutter app, you'll see the main screen with:

- **Device Discovery**: Automatically finds other QopyApp devices
- **File Picker**: Select files to share
- **Peer List**: Shows discovered devices
- **Transfer History**: Previous file transfers

### 2. Discover Peers

The app automatically discovers other QopyApp instances on your network:

1. Make sure all devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
2. Launch QopyApp on multiple devices
3. Wait a few seconds for discovery to complete
4. You should see other devices appear in the peer list

### 3. Send a File

To send a file to another device:

1. Tap the **"Select File"** button
2. Choose a file from your device
3. Select a peer from the list
4. Tap **"Send"**
5. The recipient will see a notification to accept the file

### 4. Receive a File

When someone sends you a file:

1. You'll see a notification
2. Tap to open QopyApp
3. Review the file details
4. Tap **"Accept"** to receive or **"Decline"** to reject

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Settings

Access settings by tapping the gear icon in the app:

- **Device Name**: Change how your device appears to others
- **Auto-Accept**: Automatically accept files from trusted devices
- **Download Location**: Choose where received files are saved
- **Notifications**: Enable/disable transfer notifications

### Advanced Settings

For advanced users, you can modify:

- **Discovery Timeout**: How long to search for peers
- **Transfer Chunk Size**: Size of file transfer chunks
- **Encryption**: Enable/disable end-to-end encryption
- **Port Settings**: Customize network ports

## üåê Network Requirements

### Local Network

QopyApp works on local networks where devices can communicate directly:

- **Wi-Fi Networks**: Home, office, or public Wi-Fi
- **Ethernet**: Wired connections on the same network
- **Mobile Hotspot**: Using a phone as a hotspot

### Firewall Settings

Make sure your firewall allows:

- **mDNS**: Port 5353 (UDP)
- **WebSocket**: Port 8080 (TCP)
- **File Transfer**: Port 8081 (TCP)

### Troubleshooting Network Issues

If devices aren't discovering each other:

1. **Check Network**: Ensure all devices are on the same network
2. **Restart Discovery**: Pull down to refresh the peer list
3. **Check Firewall**: Temporarily disable firewall to test
4. **Restart App**: Close and reopen QopyApp
5. **Check Logs**: Look for error messages in the app

## üìÅ File Types

### Supported Formats

QopyApp supports all file types:

- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, SVG
- **Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WMV
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG
- **Archives**: ZIP, RAR, 7Z, TAR, GZ
- **Code**: Any text-based files
- **Any File**: QopyApp can transfer any file type

### File Size Limits

- **No Hard Limit**: QopyApp can transfer files of any size
- **Network Dependent**: Transfer speed depends on network quality
- **Memory Usage**: Large files use more device memory during transfer

## üîí Security Features

### End-to-End Encryption

All file transfers are encrypted:

- **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: Modern encryption algorithm
- **Ed25519 Signatures**: Cryptographic signatures for authentication
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each transfer uses unique keys

### Privacy

QopyApp respects your privacy:

- **No Cloud Storage**: Files never leave your local network
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect personal information
- **Local Only**: All communication stays on your network

### Trusted Devices

You can mark devices as trusted:

1. Tap on a device in the peer list
2. Select **"Mark as Trusted"**
3. Trusted devices can send files without confirmation

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### App Won't Start

**Symptoms**: App crashes on startup or shows error

**Solutions**:
1. Restart your device
2. Clear app data and reinstall
3. Check if you have enough storage space
4. Update to the latest version

#### Can't Find Other Devices

**Symptoms**: No peers appear in the list

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure all devices are on the same Wi-Fi
2. Check firewall settings
3. Restart the discovery service
4. Try connecting to a different network

#### File Transfer Fails

**Symptoms**: Transfer starts but doesn't complete

**Solutions**:
1. Check network stability
2. Ensure both devices have enough storage
3. Try transferring a smaller file first
4. Restart both devices

#### Slow Transfer Speed

**Symptoms**: Files transfer but very slowly

**Solutions**:
1. Move closer to the Wi-Fi router
